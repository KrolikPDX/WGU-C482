# WGU-C482
Course work for WGU's course C482. This application uses JavaFX to create a static inventory of parts and products which the user can add, modify, or delete. 

## Overview
WGU-C482 is a JavaFX app that will ask for user input to add, modify, or delete parts and products. The course did not require the project to save data upon exit, and thus this feature is not included. This project incorporates: 

- Java + JavaFX
- Static data storage
- Data modification 
- Data traversing + searching
